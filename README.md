Barony Saver. 
Its super easy to use. Just start the program. It will find barony.exe if you are running it. Then it will locate the save folder and it will save all files to memory.
If a file is changed it will update that change to memory. If a file is deleted (i.e you die) the file will be restored to the folder again. 
If its not working, try run it as administrator.
